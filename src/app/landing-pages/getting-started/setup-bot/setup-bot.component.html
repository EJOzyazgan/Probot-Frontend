    <h2>Creating Your Bot:</h2>

    <p>
        In order to make it easy to get started, we have sample bots bellow which are already set up and simply need to
        be uploaded to Heroku or another hosting service. We currently only have sample bots for Python and Javascript
        with more on the way!
    </p>

        <div class="language-icon" (click)="SendRepoEvent('python')">
            <a href="https://github.com/EJOzyazgan/Probot-Python-Bot">

            </a>
        </div>

        <div class="language-icon" (click)="SendRepoEvent('js')">
            <a href="https://github.com/EJOzyazgan/Probot-Javascript-Bot">
                <svg-icon [applyCss]="true" src="../../assets/javascript.svg"></svg-icon>

    <h4 class="sub-cat">Bot Requierments</h4>

    <p>
        When creating your bot, there must be an endpoint `/bet`. This is the endpoint that Probot Playground will call
        in order to communicate with your bot. This endpoint must be a direct child to your URL. For a guide on setting
        up the endpoint be sure to check out the sample bots above.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are free to handle the request from Probot Playground however you would like, however, your bot must respond
        within five seconds. Failure to respond in time will result in your bot folding its current hand. If your bot
        errors when called the current hand will also be folded.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Tables</h2>

    <h4 class="sub-cat">Joining Tables</h4>

    <p>
        Currently, you may join tables through the lobby page once logged into your account. When choosing a table you
        may choose the stakes (small/big blind) of the table as well as your buy-in. Each stake level has a different
        accepted buy-in range, with buy-ins getting larger with larger stakes.
    </p>

    <h4 class="sub-cat">Leaving Tables</h4>

    <p>
        In order to leave a table, your bot must respond with a bet of -1. You will then be qued to leave once the
        current hand finishes. If your bot reaches zero chips while at a table, it will be kicked from the table. You must then rejoin a table.
        This is currently only do able through the lobby page, however we will be introducing an endpoint to automate
        joining tables as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Data:</h2>

    <p>
        The data your bot receives will be a JSON object consisting of a ‘state’ and ‘history’ attribute. The ‘state’ is
        a JSON
        object of the current state of the game. The ‘history’ is an array of JSON objects representing all the past
        states of the current hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following game data is an example of what data would look like after a round of betting. Make sure to
        download your game data for more accurate data.
    </p>

    <p class="game-data">
        <a href='../../assets/example-game-data.zip' download>Example Game Data
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you wish to store the data recived by your bot you are free to do so. All of your game data will be available
        for download on your profile as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Hosting Your Bot:</h2>

    <p>
        You are free to use any hosting service you may like. If you are looking for a good hosting service, we recomend
        using Heroku. They have great stability and their free tier is perfect for getting started.
