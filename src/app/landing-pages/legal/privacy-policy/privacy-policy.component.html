<p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) request rectification or erasure, (iii) restrict the processing of your personal information and (iv) if applicable, data portability. In certain circumstances, you also may have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below.

<p>Data protection law in Europe requires a &ldquo;lawful basis&rdquo; for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area. Our lawful bases include, without limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing the contract that we have with you and/or other users: in certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver our Website, products and services to you and/or other users;</li>
<li>Legal compliance: sometimes, the law says we need to collect and use your data. For example, tax laws require us to retain records of transactions and payments made through our Website; and</li>
<li>Legitimate interests: this is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means that we have a good and fair reason to use your personal information and data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights. We sometimes require your personal information and data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.&nbsp;For example, we use identity, device and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep our Website and our products and services secure. We also may send to you promotional communications about our Website and our products and services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.&nbsp;We analyze how users interact with our Website and our products and services, so that we can understand better what elements of our Website and our products and services, including their designs, are working well and which are not working so well. This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience that we offer all our users.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Data Protection Authority</em></strong></p>
<p>Subject to applicable law, if you are a citizen or resident of the European Economic Area, then you also have the right to (i) object to the Company&rsquo;s use of your personal information and (ii) lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or the United Kingdom Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, which is the lead supervisory authority in the European Union:</p>
