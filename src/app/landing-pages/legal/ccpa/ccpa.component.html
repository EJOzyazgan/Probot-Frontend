</ul>
<p><u>Use of Personal Information</u></p>
<p>We may use, sell or disclose the personal information that we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you share your name and contact information to request a price quote or ask a question about our products or services, then we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry. If you provide your personal information to purchase a product or service, then we will use that information to process your payment and facilitate delivery.

<li>To provide, support, personalize and develop our Website, products and services;</li>
<li>To create, maintain, customize and secure your account with us;</li>
<li>To process your requests, purchases, transactions and payments and prevent transactional fraud;</li>

<p>The Company may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose or sell your personal information, subject to your right to opt-out of those sales (see <em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em>). When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. The CCPA prohibits third parties who purchase the personal information that we hold from reselling it unless you have received explicit notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contractors, service providers and other third parties that we use to support our business;</li>

<li>To third parties to market their products or services to you if you have consented to or not opted out of these disclosures; and/or</li>
<li>To other third parties with your consent.</li>

<p><u>Your Rights and Choices </u></p>
<p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p><em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that the Company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we then will disclose to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you;</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request); and</li>
<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
<ul>
<li>Sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
<li>Disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Deletion Request Rights </em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that the Company delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we then will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>
<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>
<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law;</li>
<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1546 <em> seq.</em>);</li>
<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information&rsquo;s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research&rsquo;s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;</li>
<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation; and/or</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em></p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling us at 858-371-9372</li>
<li>E-mailing us at team@probotplayground.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You also may make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor&rsquo;s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see <em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em>.</p>
<p><em>Response Timing and Format</em></p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), then we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>If you have an account with us, then we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, then we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
<p>Any disclosures that we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&rsquo;s receipt. The response we provide also will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, then we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p><em>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</em></p>
<p>If you are sixteen (16) years of age or older, then you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the &ldquo;right to opt-out&rdquo;). We do not sell the personal information of consumers that we actually know are less than sixteen (16) years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the &ldquo;right to opt-in&rdquo;) from either the consumer who is between thirteen (13) and sixteen (16) years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than thirteen (13) years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>
<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling us at 858-371-9372</li>
<li>E-mailing us at team@probotplayground.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we then will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling us at 858-371-9372</li>
<li>E-mailing us at team@probotplayground.com</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
<p><u>Non-Discrimination</u></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or</li>
<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong><em>can result</em></strong>in different prices, rates or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive that we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information&rsquo;s value and contain written terms that describe the program&rsquo;s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
