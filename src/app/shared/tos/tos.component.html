Any details and restrictions regarding Chips and the Program not specified in these Terms of Use or on the Website shall be determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p><em><u>Eligibility</u></em>. The Program may be made available to registered users of the Website, and any person whose access to the Website has been terminated or suspended by the Company shall not be eligible to participate in the Program. The Company reserves the right to impose additional eligibility restrictions in connection with the Program, any Chip earning opportunity and any use of or redemption opportunities available for Chips at any time and in its sole and absolute discretion. If you attempt to obtain more than one user account for the Website, then all Chips in your user account(s) may be forfeited and the Company may, at its sole and absolute discretion, terminate your user account(s) and permanently ban you from using the Website and/or any other Company service. The Program is provided to individuals only, and corporations, associations or other groups may not participate in the Program. No individual, company, club, association or group shall use or direct, encourage or allow other persons to use a user account for purposes of accumulating or aggregating Chips for combined use without our express written permission in each case.</p>
<p><em><u>Intellectual Property Rights in Chips</u></em>. By purchasing, earning, winning or otherwise using and acquiring, as applicable, Chips, you acquire no ownership right or interest in or to such Chips or any other intellectual property or proprietary information of Company. The Company reserves all right, title and interest in and to all Chips and the Program. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, and any other policies established by Company from time to time, the Company grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and ephemeral license to access and use your Chips as we may allow from time to time through the Website, solely for your non-commercial, personal entertainment purposes only.</p>
<p><em><u>Earning Chips</u></em>. There may be various ways offered through the Website to earn or accumulate Chips from time to time, or through programs and invitations offered by the Company or its business partners from time to time. From time to time, the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion may provide registered users with opportunities to earn or accumulate Chips by completing various actions on the Website (&ldquo;<strong>Online Chip Opportunity</strong>&rdquo;). Online Chip Opportunities may include, but are not limited to, becoming a registered user of the Website, logging into the Website and other promotional activities offered to registered users by the Company from time to time. Any Online Chip Opportunity is subject to change, termination or modification at any time without notice and in the Company&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion. The Program may make available from time to time more than one type or class of Chips (&ldquo;<strong>Chip Levels</strong>&rdquo;), and the number of classes or types of Chips that may be earned by participating in an Online Chip Opportunity will be disclosed when such Online Chip Opportunity is presented. In accumulating Chips, you may not rely upon any Chip Levels, and the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion and without notice, may change, modify, terminate or withdraw any Chip Levels at any time.</p>
<p><em><u>Using Chips</u></em>. The Company may allow users from time to time to use and redeem Chips to play games, enter tournaments and/or to conduct such other activities as the Company makes available through the Website. Chips may only be used for the activities expressly allowed through the Website and cannot be converted into cash or any other currency. The Company reserves the right to modify, amend, terminate or revise the Chip Program at any time, with or without notice, in its sole and absolute discretion, including, without limitation, the amount of Chips required to redeem an award, play games or otherwise conduct an activity through the Website.

Chips cannot be used in combination with any other discount, coupon or offer unless specifically allowed by the terms of a specific promotion. Once redeemed or used, there are no refunds, returns or exchanges for additional Chips, cash, or other goods and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Chips Have No Monetary Value</u></em>. Chips have no monetary value and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Chips may not be redeemed for cash or transferred, sold, auctioned, bartered, brokered, assigned or used to engage in any gambling, prohibited or illegal activity. Any Chips obtained by such means by any person or entity will be considered to have been fraudulently obtained and deemed void, and such Chips may be confiscated or cancelled by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. Chips are non-refundable and you are not entitled to any refund or other goods and services for unused Chips. Chips will not be replaced, reissued or credited if lost, stolen or otherwise altered or destroyed.</p>
<p>CHIPS DO NOT CONSTITUTE PROPERTY OF ANY USER AND HAVE NO VALUE OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM. CHIPS ARE CREDITS THAT THE COMPANY MAY REVOKE AT ANY TIME AS SET FORTH HEREIN AND IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION. CHIPS ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, UPON DEATH, AS PART OF A DOMESTIC RELATIONS MATTER OR OTHERWISE. Each user is responsible for ensuring that the information in such user&rsquo;s account is accurate and kept current, including with respect to any Chips. If a user believes that such user&rsquo;s account does not properly reflect the number of Chips earned or accumulated from engaging in any activities, then such user must contact the Company to resolve the issue; provided that the resolution of such issue, including, without limitation, any Chip or account discrepancy, shall be determined by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Program may be a violation of applicable criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Company reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. All questions or disputes regarding a user&rsquo;s eligibility for the Program, the earning, crediting or use of Chips, or a user&rsquo;s compliance with these Terms of Use shall be resolved by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion, and such resolution shall be final.</p>
<p><em><u>Termination of Program</u></em>. The Company reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the Program and any Chips at any time, with or without notice. Any Chips remaining in a user&rsquo;s account at the time of termination shall be forfeited and no compensation shall be provided.</p>

You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</p>
<p><strong><u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</u></strong></p>
<p>All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction).</p>
<p><strong><u>Arbitration</u></strong><strong><u> Agreement</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with THE Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong></p>
<p><em><u>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</u></em><em>.</em> Any and all claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with these Terms of Use, the Website or the use of any product, service or information provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services and goods provided under these Terms of Use.</p>
<p><em><u>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</u></em>. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (<strong>&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;</strong>) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: team@probotplayground.com. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, then either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>
<p><em><u>Arbitration Rules</u></em>. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (<strong>&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;</strong>), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (<strong>&ldquo;ADR Provider&rdquo;</strong>) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, then the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (<strong>&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;</strong>) governing the arbitration are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., then the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants to you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, then the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
<p><em><u>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration</u></em>. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, then the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; and the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
<p><em><u>Time Limits</u></em><em>.</em> Except as otherwise set forth herein, if you or the Company pursue arbitration, then arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
<p><em><u>Authority of Arbitrator</u></em>. If arbitration is initiated, then the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>
<p><em><u>Waiver of Jury Trial</u></em><em>.</em> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p><em><u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</u></em>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Confidentiality</u></em>. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
<p><em><u>Severability</u></em>. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p><em><u>Right to Waive</u></em><em>.</em> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p><em><u>Survival of Agreement</u></em>. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Small Claims Court</u></em><em>.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
<p><em><u>Emergency Equitable Relief</u></em>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p><em><u>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration</u></em><em>. </em>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
<p><em><u>Courts</u></em><em>.</em> In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Diego County, California, for such purpose.</p>
<p><strong><u>Limitation on Time to File Claims</u></strong></p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</p>
<p><em><u>Construction; Independent Contractors; Assignment</u></em>. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word &ldquo;including&rdquo; means &ldquo;including without limitation.&rdquo; Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.

<p><em><u>Waiver and Severability</u></em>. No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, then such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p><em><u>Entire Agreement</u></em>. These Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, Terms of Sale and other policies referred to herein constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Website.</p>
